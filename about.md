BHCC was formed in 2003 to bring together cyclists in the Greater Boston area who enjoy the physical and social benefits of group riding, training, and racing.

We have members of all abilities and disciplines. Our membership is active in supporting the communities where we live and ride. Founded in Milton, MA, BHCC now has riders and racers from throughout the South Shore and Greater Boston.

Everyone is welcome: novices, weekend warriors, charity riders, triathletes, mountain bikers and road racers. There are club organized rides six days a week, and we give you the tools to ride with others on a moment's notice.

Our road, mountain bike and cyclocross race development programs and racing teams are open to any one, of all ages, who wants help beginning to race or wishes to join our well established team.

We are the founders of the Blue Hills Classic, a USA Cycling permitted road race held each spring in the Blue Hills Reservation. The Blue Hills Classic is now co-presented by BHCC and Velo 545, a Newton, MA-based Masters racing team.
