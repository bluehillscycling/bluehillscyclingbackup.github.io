<p>BHCC,<br><br>September seems to be marathon month. The weekend after the Landmine Classic, there is a new marathon race called The Freetown 50. All the important information is up on BikeReg and www.freetown50.com.<br><br>This race also has a 25 mile option and team relay options as well if 50 miles of mountain biking isn't your thing. The best part, it's very close.<br><br></p>
