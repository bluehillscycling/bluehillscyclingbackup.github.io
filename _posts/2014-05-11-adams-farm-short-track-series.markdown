<h5 style="padding-bottom:8px">About Short Track Racing<&#47;h5><br />
Short track racing takes place on a short course (1.4miles) that is fast with very few technical challenges. The A Race is 30 minutes, while the B Race is 25 minutes. This series is set up as a training race and all races are open to anyone of any ability.</p>
<p>Typically, the A Race will be pros, cat 1s, and fast cat 2s. The B Race will typically be beginners, cat 3s, and new cat 2s. You may race both the A and B race in a single day for an extra workout. There are no prizes other than glory and bragging rights. Some races will have prizes for primes.</p>
