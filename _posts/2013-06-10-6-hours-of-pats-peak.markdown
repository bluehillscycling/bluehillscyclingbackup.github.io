<div><span>When I arrived at Pat&rsquo;s Peak for the 6 hour endurance race, the rain had just stopped. They received 3 inches of rain in the last 48 hours and the last remaining bit of snow on the mountain had finally melted. The ground was saturated from the snow that was blown all season so the course was going to be extremely muddy.<&#47;span><&#47;div></p>

<div><span>The race started really fast. The course went up hill immediately. It was very muddy and pretty steep in spots. With all of the congestion, mud and steep turns there was a lot of running, walking and pushing.&nbsp; My heart rate was well into the 180&rsquo;s which is not where I want to be in the first 30 minutes of a 6 hour race.<&#47;span><&#47;div><br />

<div><span>The latter half of the course was awesome. The course started to descend back to the base. There were lots of technical rocks and drops to negotiate all with really big puddles on the other side that hid any potential obstacles.<&#47;span><&#47;div></p>
<div><span><br><&#47;span><&#47;div></p>
<div><span>I made a wrong turn on Lap 1, 2 and 3 which cost me a bit of time. I was focusing so hard on staying up right that I just wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to the course. By Lap 4 I started to settle in. I started to really rock the course and get into the groove. Right about when I started getting comfortable, my small chain ring blew of the bike. I think all of the mud had finally caught up to my drive train. I really needed that chain ring, but now I had to rely on the middle ring. &nbsp;I am no stranger to standing up an grinding it out but with all of the mud, it was very difficult to get any traction in a 32 tooth chain ring so there was going to be a lot more walking and running next to my bike.<&#47;span><&#47;div></p>
<div><span><br><&#47;span><&#47;div></p>
<div><span>By the end of Lap 4, my rear brake completely failed. This was very problematic and led to me crashing on&nbsp; a very steep, narrow muddy descent on the end of Lap 4, 5 and 6 (Lap 7 I finally was smart enough to walk it). I think I missed my brake more than the chain ring.&nbsp; I realized by lap 5 that I was starting to lap a number of riders in my field. This really kept me going and took my mind off of all of the mechanical mishaps that were bringing me down.<&#47;span><&#47;div></p>
<div><span><br><&#47;span><&#47;div></p>
<div><span>I finished with 7 laps which put me in 5<sup>th<&#47;sup>&nbsp;place. I was 6 minutes behind 4<sup>th<&#47;sup>&nbsp;place. Time to rebuild the bike for the next one. New chain rings, bottom bracket and pads are on order from Landry&rsquo;s.<&#47;span><&#47;div></p>
