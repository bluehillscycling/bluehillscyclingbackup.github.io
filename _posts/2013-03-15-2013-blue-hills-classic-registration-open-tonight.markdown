<p>2013 Blue Hills Classic - May 5th, 2013<br><br>Registration for the BHC opens tonight at 7pm.<br><br>To register click <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.bikereg.com&#47;Net&#47;17962" target="_blank">here<&#47;a><br><br>The Cat 5 and 4 fields will fill up fast and I recommend signing up early. This event is also pre-reg only with no day of registration.<br><br>This year we added a new aspect to the race with a King of the Mountains competition. For the Cat 4 and 5 fields, the first across the line on lap number two will win BarFly mounts. The Masters and Cat 3s have two chances to win with KOM on laps 2 and 4. This may change some the dynamics of the race, but we will have to wait until race day to find out.<br><br>This race is very important for our club, and we will need as many volunteers as we can get to make it happen. We need course marshals, registration help, and drivers to lead and follow the pelotons. We will also need a few volunteers to help hand out notices to homes and businesses along the course a few weeks prior to the event, as well as a course sweep team the day before to mark road hazards and sweep any general road debris off the course.<br><br>Let me know what you would like to volunteer for.<br><br>Pete<br><br><br><br><br></p>
