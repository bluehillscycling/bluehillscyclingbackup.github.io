<div>3&#47;30-3&#47;31 BHCC Race Report<&#47;div></p>
<div><br><&#47;div></p>
<div>Racing in on for 2013!<&#47;div></p>
<div><br><&#47;div></p>
<div>Blue Hill had racers in both in Plymouth, Ma andCharlestown, RI this past weekend.<&#47;div></p>
<div>Jonathan Doller was able to get in a break on the first lapof the B race at Charge Pond. The group made it stick to the end and Jonathantook 2<sup>nd<&#47;sup> place!<&#47;div></p>
<div><br><&#47;div></p>
<div>Murph and I were down in Rhode Island at the Chris HindsMemorial Crit. It&rsquo;s a crit course on some old runways along the water, so thereis always wind at this one. Murph took 12<sup>th<&#47;sup> place in the 50+ despitehaving to hit the pits to swap out a flat.<&#47;div></p>
<div><br><&#47;div></p>
<div>I raced in the P123&rsquo;s and it was nothing but fast. I averaged 26 mph for the race, stuck with the lead pack and finished 22<sup>nd<&#47;sup>&nbsp;on the day. The entire field was lapped by two that got off the front early&hellip;not use to seeing the leader go flying by as your trying to set up for the final sprint, but was a great ride in prep for Marblehead next week.<br><br>A couple of pictures by my 11 year old head mechanic &#47; coach, Jaymz<br><br>
