<p><span>Looking to up your game on the bike as well as improve your overall fitness?&nbsp; Consider challenging yourself in 2013 by participating in the boot camp workout programs organized by fellow Blue Hills Cycling Club member, Maureen Conlon.&nbsp; Perhaps, many of you have seen Maureen and her die hard boot campers running morning drills outside Fontbonne Academy or running up the Blue Hill access road.&nbsp; Common weaknesses among cyclists are core strength and cardio endurance.&nbsp; As you can see from the program descriptions below, there is a heavy emphasis on improving core strength and maximizing cardio-vascular performance in Maureen&rsquo;s boot camp programs.&nbsp; If you want to participate in a camp to get a sense of how far you can push yourself, you are welcome to show and go, much like the Club&rsquo;s group rides.&nbsp; For BHCC members wishing to participate in Maureen&rsquo;s boot camp program, the drop-in rate is $12.00 per session.&nbsp; If you prefer to preregister for the 4-week block of boot camps, the cost is $40.00 ($10.00 per class).&nbsp; Feel free to contact Maureen directly at <a href="mailto:maureen@kneededtherapy.info"><span>maureen@kneededtherapy.info<&#47;span><&#47;a>.

<p><b><span>ADVANCED BOOT CAMP
<p><&#47;p><&#47;span><&#47;b><&#47;p></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
<p><&#47;p><&#47;span><&#47;p></p>
<p><span>* Meets Saturdays from 7-8:30am. Locations include Blue Hills; Fontbonne Academy (we meet here and cover all the hills and&nbsp;stairs&nbsp;in and around Adams St); Houghton's Pond; Milton Council on Aging (we meet here and cover hills and stairs by the hospital and neighboring streets).
<p><&#47;p><&#47;span><&#47;p></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
<p><&#47;p><&#47;span><&#47;p></p>
<p><span>If you like to run, enjoy stairs and hills and are looking to strengthen your cardiovascular system, this is the class to take.&nbsp; In 90 minutes, we&nbsp;run up and down all the hills and stairs Milton has to offer.&nbsp; You'll be challenged with ankle bands, dogsleds, pushups (diagonal, negative, fast, slow) and lunges, to name a few. This class ends with an intense 15-20 minute&nbsp;abs and core workout.

<p><b><span>JUMP ROPE DRILLS
<p><&#47;p><&#47;span><&#47;b><&#47;p></p>
<p><span>* Meets Friday mornings from 5:30-6:45am at the Fontbonne gym.&nbsp;Participants bring a jump rope and&nbsp;(1) 10 lb. weight for abs.
<p><&#47;p><&#47;span><&#47;p></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
<p><&#47;p><&#47;span><&#47;p></p>
<p><span>The most intense class of the week is Jump Rope Drills.&nbsp; In between our 5-minute&nbsp;jump rope sessions, we cover aerobic and anaerobic drills (sprints, crab walk, prisoner lunges, burpees, elephant walk, inchworms,&nbsp;jump lunges and power squats).&nbsp; There's also a&nbsp;5-7 minute&nbsp;ankle band drill that will leave your quads burning (in a good way)! This class ends with an intense abs and core workout that incudes&nbsp;using a 10 lb. weight for an added challenge.
