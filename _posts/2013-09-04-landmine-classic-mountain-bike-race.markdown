<p><span>The Landmine Classic at Wompatuck is this Sunday. If you're new to MTB racing I recommend this one.<br><br>This race is great for so many reasons... it's close to us, its a fast and fun course that's mostly flat, typically has a great turnout, and offers many distances.<br><br>With the exception of the marathon class (50 miles) everyone starts at 10:30am.<br><br>I'll be there with a cooler of our sponsor's finest for after the race.<br><br>Registration is open on BikeReg&nbsp;https:&#47;&#47;www.bikereg.com&#47;Net&#47;18469<&#47;span></p>
