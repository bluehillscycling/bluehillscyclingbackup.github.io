<div dir="ltr">Last Saturday, Charge Pond B Race.&nbsp; Jon Doller and a dude from another team got away a little in the very early laps.&nbsp; I and that other dude's teammate found ourselves on the front with no motivation to chase Jon and his companion and the rest of the group just followed us.&nbsp; Once the group realized what was going on Jon and his companion, who were obviously working well together, had a nice gap.&nbsp; I stayed on the front of the field for the rest of the race and followed just about every attempt that was made to bring Jon back and passively let the other pursuers do the work thinking that I could "counter attack" if we reached Jon.&nbsp; I followed a lot of unsuccessful attempts and Jon stayed away with the other dude until the end of the race.&nbsp; Jon took second to his breakaway partner, I took 6th from the field sprint, and Chad was 10th.&nbsp; Three BHCCers finished in the top 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;   It was a training race, but I think we employed some nice tactics.&nbsp; <br><br />
