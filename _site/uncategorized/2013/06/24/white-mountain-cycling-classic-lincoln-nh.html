<div><span><b><i><span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Jonathan Doller--Cat 4&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><span><span lang="EN">I know everyone talks about the importance of &ldquo;recovery,&rdquo; but I never knew first-hand how important it really is until this week.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;After completing the B2B last Saturday and then riding 4 times during the week averaging 40-45 miles each, my legs were pretty spent going into the weekend.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;By Friday, I was regretting riding so much.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;My legs were heavy and the &ldquo;burn&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t going away as fast as usual.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;But, the White Mountain Cycling Classic is a really nice race (including a free T-shirt and free lunch after!) and I wasn&rsquo;t going to miss it.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-54"></a></p>
<div><span><span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;This race has a little bit of everything, which always makes for a challenging day in the saddle.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;It consists of 9-laps (which they shortened to 8 due to time, I believe) on a rolling circuit that has a couple of steep ramps, a couple of ripping descents, a few dicey corners and a long false-flat drag along the Kancamagus Highway.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;The constant accelerations and decelerations tend to make the peloton yo-yo quite a bit and, if you&rsquo;re caught out, it can take a really big effort just to latch back on. Add to that the fact that the Cat 4 boys seemed a little tentative on the descents into the corners.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;I felt like I had to brake a lot more than I wanted to and wasted a lot of speed and momentum.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Oh well, better to have a safe race than a fast one where guys end up on the tarmac.<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&nbsp;Luckily, having done this race last year, I sort of knew what to expect and managed to stay well-positioned throughout the race.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;The first lap, which is usually no more than a shake-down lap, was interesting, to say the least.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;We had something occur that I had never experienced.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;As we approached the start&#47;finish at the end of the lap, the officials stopped the entire peloton and pulled us off the course!&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Apparently, there were reports of guys violating the yellow line rule on the Kanc.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;It must have been behind me, because I didn&rsquo;t see anything from where I was.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;At any rate, the whole field basically got put in &ldquo;time out&rdquo; for a few minutes while the official gave us a scolding.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;We had to let the Cat 5 field (which started a few minutes after us) pass before we were released.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;So now, in addition to racing each other, we were also dodging the Cat 5 guys who had gotten dropped.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;The whole thing was a bit strange, to say the least.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Once we got back to racing, the laps started ticking by with a couple of small attacks on the hills and a couple of little digs on the Kanc.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Each time, however, the whole field was back together in a matter of minutes.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;It was definitely looking like a group sprint finish.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;The last time up the climbs, I slipped off the lead group a bit, but was able to catch back on by the time we took the right-hander onto the Kanc for the final time.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;However, right when I needed a little recovery from my effort just to catch back on, someone up front decided it was time to put the hammer down!&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;I struggled to hang on for a few minutes but finally got tailed off the back with about 4 other riders with about 2 miles to go.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;The lead group was tantalizingly close, maybe 200 meters up the road, but the group I was in didn&rsquo;t have the legs to catch back on before the final turn into the Loon Mountain parking lot.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Knowing we weren&rsquo;t going to factor in the finish, I sat up a bit to ride to the finish.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;When the guys I was with started sprinting for the 16<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;place finish (where were those legs when we were chasing, boys?!), I was content to just spin across for a 20<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;place finish at 28 seconds behind the winner.&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
