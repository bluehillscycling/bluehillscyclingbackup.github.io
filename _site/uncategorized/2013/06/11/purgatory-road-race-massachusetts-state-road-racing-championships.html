<div><b><i>Bart Lipinski - Masters 35+&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>After somewhat of a peak two weeks ago at Killington, I was trying to ride it out as long as possible. Trying to rest as much as possible, but not too much as to fall off the edge I was trying to stay on. I was kind of looking forward to this race even though I wasn't sure what to expect. Last year I finished 29th and with guys like Mark McCormack in the field, left me a little further in doubt.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Still wasn't sure during the first lap. Legs were still feeling heavy. &lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-55"></a>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I few small breaks, but nothing seemed to last longer than a lap. I was almost sure nothing was going to stick so I buried myself in the group and tried to do as little as possible to save everything for the last climb and field sprint.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The masters 35+ race consists of 5 - 11 miles laps. Each with just over 800' of climbing per lap. The last 1K is almost exactly the same as the Blue Hills service road. 3 steps to the top with a 200M sprint to the finish.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>At the end of the 3rd lap two riders got off the front and opened up a sizeable gap. About half way through the 3rd lap two more took off. I'm sure everyone was thinking the same as myself. They aren't going to get caught. Just a little bit further up the (about<span>&nbsp; &lt;&#47;span&gt;3&#47;4's of the way through the 3rd lap), something told me to go. Luckily, no one followed. One and a quarter laps to go and I was trying to bridge a gap to two guys that were trying to do the same. &lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I did manage to catch the two ahead of me just as they were catching the two leaders. Unfortunately for me I caught them at the base of the big 1K climb (but was able to keep pace with the 4 others). We all worked pretty well together for the last lap. Just before the road started to tilt up for the last 3 or 4 miles, we heard one of the course marshals' yell out "one minute thirty seconds!" I was peaking back from time to time, but was relieved that we were that far ahead and we were not going to get caught.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>As we made the last right hander to head straight up, I knew two were going to go and it was going to come down to the a fight for 3rd. I managed to pick the right wheel and followed the 3rd place rider right up to the 50 meter line and flew around him not giving him a chance to get me back. I crossed the line 3rd. And very happy that this one was over. Because the second place rider was from out of state, that moved me to a silver in the state championship. Second to Mark McCormack in the State Championship!!! Thats when it sunk in. Second to an ex-pro and an ex-national champion. I'll take that any day. Well....maybe.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I didn't do much during the race until the last lap and a quarter. For the race I averaged only 221 watts (272 NP) for the 55 miles. &lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Had a nice big steak and a couple of Harpoons when I got home with the family.....and definitely looking forward to a couple of weeks of rest.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
</span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></i></b></div></p>
