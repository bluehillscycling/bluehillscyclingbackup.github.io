<div><span><b><i><span> &lt;&#47;span&gt;Bart Lipinski - Masters 35+&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<p>Ok, so first off, I think I paid way too much attention through out the week to the weather. Rain and thunderstorms were predicted for Saturday all week. I have only done this race once before as a Cat 5 and it was cold and the sky&rsquo;s opened up. Could not see a thing, so there was always a bad taste in my mouth about this one. Thankfully, the rain held off and there was not much more that a steady drizzle for the last 3 laps. The ground was wet, but at least you could see the road and the potholes. &lt;&#47;p&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-58"></a></p>
<p>Saturday morning was kind of a weird one. I almost didn&rsquo;t even want to ride my bike, let alone race. There was no doubt that I was racing, just one of those days I felt like doing nothing.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>The race, long neutral start to the course and was feeling ok. The first few laps a guy here or there would get out a 30 second lead or so, but this was a lazy group. No one wanted to work and when someone did get off the front, teammates would block (very narrow roads).&nbsp; Two others did get out for about two laps, but everyone was back together for the last lap.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>For most of the race I was focusing on my riding position and being where I though I should be. I almost didn&rsquo;t even care about the results. Killington is 2 weeks away, the road is slick, figured I&rsquo;d play it save today.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>But&hellip;.I was able to but myself in a pretty good position. The last &frac12; mile (about 140&rsquo; up) took you into the town square, where with about .1 miles to go, a sharp right and about an 8% sprint up to the finish line. A fast lead out by one team took the pack from a group of about 30 riders to a single file line (coming into the sharp right hander). I was about 9 or 10 wheels back, turned right and dumped what I had left. Picked up all by 3 guys to finish 4&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>There were a few times I tried to get in a break (didn&rsquo;t work) or bridge the gap, but other than that, really didn&rsquo;t do much. I think that I finally figured out how to ride smart, especially when you have no teammates. Well....maybe.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
