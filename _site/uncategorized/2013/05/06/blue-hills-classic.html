<div><span><b><i>Andy Rothstein &ndash; Cat 4&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />In preparing for and thinking about the Blue Hills Classic I felt that coming over the top of Unquity when everyone was gassed from coming up the hill would be a good time to attack.&nbsp; Apparently the eventual winner was thinking the same thing because I think that&rsquo;s where he attacked after the first time up the hill. &nbsp;When he was not too far in front I considered catching up to him.&nbsp; But, I did not take any initiative and figured that since he was alone the group would catch him. &nbsp;Others must have been thinking that too because no one went for him.&nbsp; He was soon was out of sight.&nbsp; And then out of mind.&nbsp; There was no organized pursuit and we were racing for second place.&nbsp; &nbsp;The second to last time up Unquity I began to think about positioning for the finish.&nbsp; I wanted to be in the front 1&#47;3 of the group so that I would not have to work too hard and when we went up Unquity again I would be positioned so as to not get caught behind struggling riders and so that my efforts would be expended at the front of the race and not trying to get to the front.&nbsp; That plan worked well and I finished 3<sup>rd&lt;&#47;sup&gt;&nbsp;in the group&hellip;4<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;&nbsp;in the race (remember, there was a lone breakaway).
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><b><i>Jonathan Doller &ndash; Cat 4&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The race started out innocently enough, but that would soon change.&nbsp; I saw Andy Rothstein feign an early move to see who would respond, but no one did.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re going to ride 27 miles together and then settle this on the final climb,&rdquo; I thought.&nbsp; Boy, was I wrong!&nbsp; Passing the ski slope for the first time, I took the opportunity to get out front and open the throttle a bit and stretch the legs.&nbsp; On that fast section of the course, I knew I wasn&rsquo;t really going to do any damage, but it sure felt good to ride with clear roads in front of me!&nbsp; The first time up Unquity saw Sean Pantellere from STAMPEDE! attack over the top and would pretty much never be heard from again.&nbsp; He got such a gap so fast that I think most of the field (myself included) didn&rsquo;t even realize he was away (note to self: pay more attention).&nbsp; Needless to say, the KOM on lap two was a formality as Pantellere was so far off the front that he was out of sight&mdash;not easy to do on the BHC course.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m pretty sure part of the reason we were never able to organize a chase is that most of the field didn&rsquo;t realize that we were chasing!&nbsp; The peloton stayed together for the remaining three laps with the pace quickening gradually as we approached the deciding climb up Unquity.&nbsp; I was in good shape making the final right-hander and just tried to avoid riders slipping off the pace as both the speed and the incline increased.&nbsp; I managed to do just that and got across the line in 7th place from the pack and 8th overall behind Pantellere.&nbsp; With Rothstein grabbing a strong 4th, I&rsquo;d say it was a good day for BHCC in our home race.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;

<div>
<b><i><span>B&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>art Lipinski &ndash; Masters 40+&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Chilly cloudy morning, but luckily the sun poked out just in time for the start of the M40+&rsquo;s.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>First lap a Wheelworks rider took off, but was reeled back in by the end of the first lap. On the 2<sup>nd&lt;&#47;sup&gt; lap, myself, a CCB rider and Expowheelman joined the Wheelworks rider and I was pretty sure we were going to get away. These were 3 strong riders and a good group to make something happen&hellip;&hellip;well for at least a &frac12; a lap or so. It seem like the only time throughout the race the group showed any concern.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>A few more guys would peel off the front for a bit and a CCB rider almost made it without getting caught but it was coming down to a field group sprint. Ari was a great help in giving me just enough of a rest to get ready for the last climb up Unquity.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I stayed about 10 wheels back and made sure to stay as far to the left as possible (as to not get boxed in). Just at the little flat before the last little climb to the finish I saw a rider out of the corner of my eye start to get out of the saddle&hellip;that was my queue to start my sprint.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I went as far as I can to the left on the sprint, but the guy that initiated it was fading and trying to get out of the way. Of course he would swerve to the left. It kind of pinched me off just a bit, but don&rsquo;t think it was enough to stop me from getting third. Was happy to take at least 6 spot on the sprint and not get passed. Definitely very pleased with taking 4<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;, but pissed I missed out on one of the sweet medals&hellip;..
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>A couple of more tune ups (Duxbury TT and Sterling) before Killington. Feeling pretty good right now.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
