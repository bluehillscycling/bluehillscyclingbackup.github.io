<div>Early Sunday morning things were shaping up to be a fast day in <span>Marblehead&lt;&#47;span&gt; at the Michael <span>Schott&lt;&#47;span&gt; Memorial Circuit Race. Sun was shining, but that always blowing wind seemed to go through just about whatever you were wearing.&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><b>Andy <span>Rothstein&lt;&#47;span&gt; race in the 4&#47;5's;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I raced at <span>Marblehead&lt;&#47;span&gt; Cat 4&#47;5.&nbsp; I was well positioned in about the front 20 for all but the first lap of the race.&nbsp; On the last lap I got crowded out lining up for the final corner and lost position.&nbsp; By the time I came up the final climb I had made up ground, but it was too late to catch back on to the front.&nbsp; I ended up placing 17<span>th&lt;&#47;span&gt; about a few seconds off the winner.&nbsp; I wish I could have applied my final effort at the front of the group instead of using it to make up lost ground.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><b>Bart Lipinski &ndash; P123&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>I have to say, I was a bit nervous about this one, but <span>didn&lt;&#47;span&gt;'t feel the pressure I normally put on myself. I have been racing the P123's as practice races for better preparation in the master 40+ races. So, I decided to do something I normally do not do. I sat in.&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>The only work I was going to do was to keep myself where I felt I needed to be at certain point throughout the race. I had marked a few guys that I kept my eye on the entire race.&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>Throughout the whole race guys were going off the front. If it were a <span>CCB&lt;&#47;span&gt; guy, then there was a wall of teammates to get around. There were a few breaks that go off to about a 30-40 second lead, but all were reeled back in.&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>One big crash occurred sprinting out of the hairpin. It appeared that a couple of guys got tangled up. As we went around them, I had to dodge a real wheel that was bouncing down the road in front of me (was almost going as fast as me as well). &lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>Big Dean from <span>Fitwerx&lt;&#47;span&gt; was marked by everyone. He did manager to break off the front with another guy with 2 laps to go. But surprisingly (at least by me) is that we caught him and he was swallowed up on the last turn.&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>I had a pretty good last lap. Was probably a little further back than where I wanted to be on the last turn, but did make up a bunch of positions coming out of the turn and up the last hill&hellip;..until I was almost taken out by the rider swerving in front of me. Plenty of time to react, but lost some of my momentum which probably cost me the chance to make a few more spot than I did.&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>In the end I finished 23<sup>rd&lt;&#47;sup&gt; out of 82 starters, just 3 seconds back from the winner.&lt;&#47;div&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;
