<div><b><i>Bart Lipinski - Masters 35+&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>After somewhat of a peak two weeks ago at Killington, I was trying to ride it out as long as possible. Trying to rest as much as possible, but not too much as to fall off the edge I was trying to stay on. I was kind of looking forward to this race even though I wasn't sure what to expect. Last year I finished 29th and with guys like Mark McCormack in the field, left me a little further in doubt.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Still wasn't sure during the first lap. Legs were still feeling heavy. &lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-55"></a>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I few small breaks, but nothing seemed to last longer than a lap. I was almost sure nothing was going to stick so I buried myself in the group and tried to do as little as possible to save everything for the last climb and field sprint.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The masters 35+ race consists of 5 - 11 miles laps. Each with just over 800' of climbing per lap. The last 1K is almost exactly the same as the Blue Hills service road. 3 steps to the top with a 200M sprint to the finish.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>At the end of the 3rd lap two riders got off the front and opened up a sizeable gap. About half way through the 3rd lap two more took off. I'm sure everyone was thinking the same as myself. They aren't going to get caught. Just a little bit further up the (about<span>&nbsp; &lt;&#47;span&gt;3&#47;4's of the way through the 3rd lap), something told me to go. Luckily, no one followed. One and a quarter laps to go and I was trying to bridge a gap to two guys that were trying to do the same. &lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I did manage to catch the two ahead of me just as they were catching the two leaders. Unfortunately for me I caught them at the base of the big 1K climb (but was able to keep pace with the 4 others). We all worked pretty well together for the last lap. Just before the road started to tilt up for the last 3 or 4 miles, we heard one of the course marshals' yell out "one minute thirty seconds!" I was peaking back from time to time, but was relieved that we were that far ahead and we were not going to get caught.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>As we made the last right hander to head straight up, I knew two were going to go and it was going to come down to the a fight for 3rd. I managed to pick the right wheel and followed the 3rd place rider right up to the 50 meter line and flew around him not giving him a chance to get me back. I crossed the line 3rd. And very happy that this one was over. Because the second place rider was from out of state, that moved me to a silver in the state championship. Second to Mark McCormack in the State Championship!!! Thats when it sunk in. Second to an ex-pro and an ex-national champion. I'll take that any day. Well....maybe.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I didn't do much during the race until the last lap and a quarter. For the race I averaged only 221 watts (272 NP) for the 55 miles. &lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Had a nice big steak and a couple of Harpoons when I got home with the family.....and definitely looking forward to a couple of weeks of rest.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;

<div><span><b><i>Pete Werner &ndash; Solo Men&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>When I arrived at Pat&rsquo;s Peak for the 6 hour endurance race, the rain had just stopped. They received 3 inches of rain in the last 48 hours and the last remaining bit of snow on the mountain had finally melted. The ground was saturated from the snow that was blown all season so the course was going to be extremely muddy.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The race started really fast. The course went up hill immediately. It was very muddy and pretty steep in spots. With all of the congestion, mud and steep turns there was a lot of running, walking and pushing.&nbsp; My heart rate was well into the 180&rsquo;s which is not where I want to be in the first 30 minutes of a 6 hour race.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-56"></a>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The latter half of the course was awesome. The course started to descend back to the base. There were lots of technical rocks and drops to negotiate all with really big puddles on the other side that hid any potential obstacles.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I made a wrong turn on Lap 1, 2 and 3 which cost me a bit of time. I was focusing so hard on staying up right that I just wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to the course. By Lap 4 I started to settle in. I started to really rock the course and get into the groove. Right about when I started getting comfortable, my small chain ring blew of the bike. I think all of the mud had finally caught up to my drive train. I really needed that chain ring, but now I had to rely on the middle ring. &nbsp;I am no stranger to standing up an grinding it out but with all of the mud, it was very difficult to get any traction in a 32 tooth chain ring so there was going to be a lot more walking and running next to my bike.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>By the end of Lap 4, my rear brake completely failed. This was very problematic and led to me crashing on&nbsp; a very steep, narrow muddy descent on the end of Lap 4, 5 and 6 (Lap 7 I finally was smart enough to walk it). I think I missed my brake more than the chain ring.&nbsp; I realized by lap 5 that I was starting to lap a number of riders in my field. This really kept me going and took my mind off of all of the mechanical mishaps that were bringing me down.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I finished with 7 laps which put me in 5<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;&nbsp;place. I was 6 minutes behind 4<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;&nbsp;place. Time to rebuild the bike for the next one. New chain rings, bottom bracket and pads are on order from Landry&rsquo;s.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;

<div><span><b><i>Bart Lipinski - Masters 40+&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Ok&hellip;.here it goes. A quick report on this past weekend&rsquo;s Killington Stage Race. In as few words as possible.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><b><i>Friday (day before stage 1)&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt; &ndash; Spent way too much time checking the hourly weather reports, but in a weird kind of way was excited about racing Stage 1 with weather in the low 40&rsquo;s, high winds and rain in the forecast. Not sure why&hellip;.but I was.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-57"></a>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Saturday, Stage 1 Circuit Race, 51 miles &ndash; 40+&rsquo;s were scheduled to start at 9:30, but had already changed my mind about racing in today&rsquo;s weather. Everyone was pretty much soaked as we rolled out to the neutral start. Right off the start, two guys went, but were eventually caught about 20 miles in. At that point I think it&rsquo;s pretty much safe to say that the entire field wanted this to be over. A safe and cautious ride to the finish.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Luckily for me, I had wrapped my cleats in plastic bags and tapped the hell out of them. Then put shoe covers on over them to hide them. They worked great for the first two laps. On the decent of the last lap, feet were wet and I got that &ldquo;death chill&rdquo; that you can&rsquo;t get rid of. By the end of the race, hands and fingers didn&rsquo;t work. Finished 17<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;, but had the same time as most of the favorites. Plenty of time to make it up in the next two days.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>It took about 15 minutes of sitting in the car with the heat on before I was able to unclick my helmet. Oh yea&hellip;..thanks to hypothermia, I could not stop my boy from shaking. Food, drinks and about a half hour helped fix that. Back to the condo to eat and recover.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><b><i>Sunday, Stage 2 Road Race, 62 miles&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt; &ndash; Since we could see the finish line from our window, today&rsquo;s warm-up was making the 1,500&rsquo; decent down East Mountain Road. The forecast for today was looking really good. No rain (haha), but very cold. Only in the upper 40&rsquo;s-low 50&rsquo;d for the day. Nothing like racing in the end of May in my winter clothes.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>As we rolled up to the start line&hellip;.rain&hellip;.again. Was nothing like Saturday, but WTF? We only were about 3 to 4 miles in when two went off the front (and not to be seen again). The race leader had guys trying to real them back in, so we just sat in and let them do all the work (although once again, I did way too much work&hellip;haha&hellip;surprise). There was a small break (2 guys) at about mile 40. That&rsquo;s the one I wish I acted on. These 2 finished 2<sup>nd&lt;&#47;sup&gt;and 3<sup>rd&lt;&#47;sup&gt; on the stage. But I was worried about having enough left in the tank to get back up the mountain.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>We got through the first 56 miles in just over two and a half hours. The last five were straight up. 1,500&rsquo; that would take almost 25 minutes to get to the top. Luckily I found my rhythm, and got to the top just about as fast as I was hoping to. Shaved over 3 minutes off my best time and crossed the line 11<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;, 2 minutes back from the guys I should have chased. But was very happy that I moved to 11<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;overall in the GC and that Stage 2 was in the books.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><b><i>Monday, Stage 3 Time Trial, 11 miles&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt; &ndash; Finally some sun and bright blue skies. Today&rsquo;s only issue was the wind. 15 mile an hour winds from the North West. Of course that was the direction we were heading. The finish line was also up about 500&rsquo; over the start line. So, a steady 11 mile TT climb, with a head wind. &lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Today&rsquo;s plan was simple enough&hellip;.Make the Podium. This was my chance to really move up in the GC. But right after I left the start, I realized the head wind was not just a head wind. In the valley (Rt. 4&#47;100) it was swirling. Sometimes from the front, or the right. But it would immediately switch to the left or maybe a quick push from behind. With a 80mm front wheel (only mistake I made today), I think I spent more energy trying to hold the bike straight and upright than what was going into the pedals.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The 11 miles went by quickly and before I knew it, I was sprinting with whatever I had left. I was done, it was over. And when the stage and overall GC results went up I could not believe my efforts took me to 2<sup>nd&lt;&#47;sup&gt; for the stage and moved me from 11<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;to 6<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt; overall in the GC.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>All in all, it was a great weekend to race. Ever with the shitty weather. It was great to stay with Ari for 4 days and to see and hang out with a few other friends&hellip;.off the bike for once. Next year I&rsquo;ll be on the final podium&hellip;.I promise.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
