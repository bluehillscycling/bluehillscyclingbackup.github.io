<p>Ok, so first off, I think I paid way too much attention through out the week to the weather. Rain and thunderstorms were predicted for Saturday all week. I have only done this race once before as a Cat 5 and it was cold and the sky&rsquo;s opened up. Could not see a thing, so there was always a bad taste in my mouth about this one. Thankfully, the rain held off and there was not much more that a steady drizzle for the last 3 laps. The ground was wet, but at least you could see the road and the potholes. &lt;&#47;p&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-58"></a></p>
<p>Saturday morning was kind of a weird one. I almost didn&rsquo;t even want to ride my bike, let alone race. There was no doubt that I was racing, just one of those days I felt like doing nothing.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>The race, long neutral start to the course and was feeling ok. The first few laps a guy here or there would get out a 30 second lead or so, but this was a lazy group. No one wanted to work and when someone did get off the front, teammates would block (very narrow roads).&nbsp; Two others did get out for about two laps, but everyone was back together for the last lap.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>For most of the race I was focusing on my riding position and being where I though I should be. I almost didn&rsquo;t even care about the results. Killington is 2 weeks away, the road is slick, figured I&rsquo;d play it save today.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>But&hellip;.I was able to but myself in a pretty good position. The last &frac12; mile (about 140&rsquo; up) took you into the town square, where with about .1 miles to go, a sharp right and about an 8% sprint up to the finish line. A fast lead out by one team took the pack from a group of about 30 riders to a single file line (coming into the sharp right hander). I was about 9 or 10 wheels back, turned right and dumped what I had left. Picked up all by 3 guys to finish 4&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>There were a few times I tried to get in a break (didn&rsquo;t work) or bridge the gap, but other than that, really didn&rsquo;t do much. I think that I finally figured out how to ride smart, especially when you have no teammates. Well....maybe.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>

<div><span><b><i>Andy Rothstein &ndash; Cat 4&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />In preparing for and thinking about the Blue Hills Classic I felt that coming over the top of Unquity when everyone was gassed from coming up the hill would be a good time to attack.&nbsp; Apparently the eventual winner was thinking the same thing because I think that&rsquo;s where he attacked after the first time up the hill. &nbsp;When he was not too far in front I considered catching up to him.&nbsp; But, I did not take any initiative and figured that since he was alone the group would catch him. &nbsp;Others must have been thinking that too because no one went for him.&nbsp; He was soon was out of sight.&nbsp; And then out of mind.&nbsp; There was no organized pursuit and we were racing for second place.&nbsp; &nbsp;The second to last time up Unquity I began to think about positioning for the finish.&nbsp; I wanted to be in the front 1&#47;3 of the group so that I would not have to work too hard and when we went up Unquity again I would be positioned so as to not get caught behind struggling riders and so that my efforts would be expended at the front of the race and not trying to get to the front.&nbsp; That plan worked well and I finished 3<sup>rd&lt;&#47;sup&gt;&nbsp;in the group&hellip;4<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;&nbsp;in the race (remember, there was a lone breakaway).
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;

<div><span><b><i>Jonathan Doller &ndash; Cat 4&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The race started out innocently enough, but that would soon change.&nbsp; I saw Andy Rothstein feign an early move to see who would respond, but no one did.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re going to ride 27 miles together and then settle this on the final climb,&rdquo; I thought.&nbsp; Boy, was I wrong!&nbsp; Passing the ski slope for the first time, I took the opportunity to get out front and open the throttle a bit and stretch the legs.&nbsp; On that fast section of the course, I knew I wasn&rsquo;t really going to do any damage, but it sure felt good to ride with clear roads in front of me!&nbsp; The first time up Unquity saw Sean Pantellere from STAMPEDE! attack over the top and would pretty much never be heard from again.&nbsp; He got such a gap so fast that I think most of the field (myself included) didn&rsquo;t even realize he was away (note to self: pay more attention).&nbsp; Needless to say, the KOM on lap two was a formality as Pantellere was so far off the front that he was out of sight&mdash;not easy to do on the BHC course.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m pretty sure part of the reason we were never able to organize a chase is that most of the field didn&rsquo;t realize that we were chasing!&nbsp; The peloton stayed together for the remaining three laps with the pace quickening gradually as we approached the deciding climb up Unquity.&nbsp; I was in good shape making the final right-hander and just tried to avoid riders slipping off the pace as both the speed and the incline increased.&nbsp; I managed to do just that and got across the line in 7th place from the pack and 8th overall behind Pantellere.&nbsp; With Rothstein grabbing a strong 4th, I&rsquo;d say it was a good day for BHCC in our home race.

&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Chilly cloudy morning, but luckily the sun poked out just in time for the start of the M40+&rsquo;s.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>First lap a Wheelworks rider took off, but was reeled back in by the end of the first lap. On the 2<sup>nd&lt;&#47;sup&gt; lap, myself, a CCB rider and Expowheelman joined the Wheelworks rider and I was pretty sure we were going to get away. These were 3 strong riders and a good group to make something happen&hellip;&hellip;well for at least a &frac12; a lap or so. It seem like the only time throughout the race the group showed any concern.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>A few more guys would peel off the front for a bit and a CCB rider almost made it without getting caught but it was coming down to a field group sprint. Ari was a great help in giving me just enough of a rest to get ready for the last climb up Unquity.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I stayed about 10 wheels back and made sure to stay as far to the left as possible (as to not get boxed in). Just at the little flat before the last little climb to the finish I saw a rider out of the corner of my eye start to get out of the saddle&hellip;that was my queue to start my sprint.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I went as far as I can to the left on the sprint, but the guy that initiated it was fading and trying to get out of the way. Of course he would swerve to the left. It kind of pinched me off just a bit, but don&rsquo;t think it was enough to stop me from getting third. Was happy to take at least 6 spot on the sprint and not get passed. Definitely very pleased with taking 4<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;, but pissed I missed out on one of the sweet medals&hellip;..
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>A couple of more tune ups (Duxbury TT and Sterling) before Killington. Feeling pretty good right now.

<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;<br />
<span>
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>Awesome weather, first time I wore shorts without leg or knee warmers all season. Last year it was freezing and the year before&hellip;.snow.&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>First off, the race started off kind of hectic. 3.5 mile neutral start out of the park (all downhill), but when it did start, guys were going off the front like mad. Plus there was a good amount of climbing in the first hour as well. I wanted to stay with a few guys who I knew typically get in breaks, so I tried to stay with them or as close to the as possible.&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>Here and there a guy or two would get up the road, but no one seemed concerned and we&rsquo;d end up catching them. For the first hour it seemed like it was going to be a group ride to the end.&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>At around 22 miles in, I knew there was a pretty good decent, so as we were cresting the top, I moved right out into the front (more because I wanted a clear view of the road for the descent). Worked hard to get some speed and took a peek back, and opened a gap of about 50 yards or so. At this point I was saying &ldquo;oh shit&hellip;.now what? It way too far out to try this alone, should I ease up?&ldquo; But then I heard someone say &ldquo;Come on! Let&rsquo;s keep this going!&rdquo; Two guys crossed over and I was saying to myself &ldquo;holy shit&hellip;..I just rode off the front!...and now have two others to work with!&rdquo;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>For the next 10 miles we worked together really well, but I can still see the group, and they were not too far off. After the race I heard that we were left out to dangle for a bit.<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&nbsp;And it felt like it. Every time I took a peek over my shoulder I could still see the group.&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>At around mile 35ish we had 3 more riders bridge over and that was a relief for me. I can honestly say that the 6 of us shared all the work; we all wanted to make this stick. At that point we were no longer seen by the field.&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>Other than the miles not ticking away fast enough, I was feeling really good. I was working less in the break that I was the first hour trying to stay in contact with my marks. I was starting to feel it with about 7 miles to go. There were two climbs just outside the park that I felt like I could lose the group or my legs were ready to go (kinda like at Battenkill, felt like my thighs were going to cramp just over my knees). But managed to hang in there with them as we entered the park for the final 3.5 mile climb to the finish.&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>We were still working great together although paranoid at this point that we were going to get caught. The last kick came at 200m, the pace picked up, I can see the finish line tent, but at this point didn&rsquo;t have much of a sprint as the 4 in front of me pulled away. I was more than happy to finish 5<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;, to initiate the break that stuck for 43 miles, but wish I saved something somewhere in the race to have one last spurt. But hey, these are still practice races for Killington.&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />

<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>Like all April races in the northeast, the weather for Quabbin can be as unpredictable as any out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently as 2011, race day saw about an inch of the slushy white stuff on the ground just to remind you that, regardless of what the calendar says, anything&rsquo;s possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;On a 65-mile route with just under 5,000 feet of climbing, the last thing you want to be fighting is the weather.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, thankfully, Saturday dawned clear and cool with temps expected to rise into the mid-60s with just a hint of wind&hellip;in other words, perfect cycling weather.&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>In the Cat 4&#47;5 40+ field, one thing became clear very quickly: the experience&#47;skill-level varied widely.&nbsp;&nbsp;That gave me a bit of concern because one rider who gets a little twitchy on a descent can do a lot of damage to the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the carnage from some of the fields starting before us was apparent as we rode by either ambulances stopped on the side of the road or riders sitting in the grass waiting for assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;(On a side note, Quabbin&rsquo;s also one of those races where you see a ton of guys early on riding in the opposite direction and you&rsquo;re never sure if they&rsquo;re just out for a weekend spin or if they&rsquo;ve abandoned and decided to turn around and head back to the parking lot.)&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>&nbsp;The course profile is one of those that looks like an EKG monitor readout (appropriate analogy considering the elevated heart rates pedaling up some of those climbs).&nbsp;&nbsp;There are literally no flat sections.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having raced Quabbin twice before and gotten popped off the back early each time, my goal was to just stay with the leaders over as many climbs as I could and, hopefully, onto the finishing ramp.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the neutral start down the road from the parking lot to the park entrance, everyone was pretty much keeping to themselves with the occasional smell of hot brake pads wafting through the peloton.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once out onto Route 9, a couple of guys tried to take some early fliers off the front, but only managed to get about a 30 second gap.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did find myself at the front of the peloton a few times setting the pace, but no one was really pedaling in anger at this point and I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was wasting any energy.&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div>
<span>Once the climbs started in earnest, the field was quickly slashed by about half.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did well to stay close to the front on all the early climbs and descents.&nbsp;&nbsp;The legs really started to burn around the 50-mile mark, but I did retain contact to what was still a pretty large lead group.&nbsp;&nbsp;Passing the ball fields in Ware and back onto Route 9, I knew there were only 3 more climbs to get over, including the finishing climb.&nbsp;&nbsp;I held on for the first 2 and most of the finishing climb back inside the park, but couldn&rsquo;t match the accelerations at the final kick at 200m to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;I managed to spin over the line shortly after the winner at 35<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;&#47;78 place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished in 3:00:40 (awarded same time as winner, but there were definitely some small gaps) at an average of 21.2 mph&hellip;considering my last Quabbin was a 3 hour, 44 minute &ldquo;off-the-back&rdquo; effort, I felt pretty good with the result.&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<br />

I stayed out of trouble for 63 some odd miles, ate right, and just rode with the group (there were no breakaways).&nbsp; Near the end of the race we turned into the park for the climb to the finish and I was ready.&nbsp; At one point I shifted into my inner ring because I wanted to spin more.&nbsp; That's when my chain came off, notwithstanding my chain catcher.&nbsp; I could not shift the chain back on and I had to stop and put it back on with my hand.&nbsp; I watched the race ahead of me as I tried to not be left too far behind.&nbsp; It was very disappointing (and my hand was a greasy mess)!&nbsp; The silver lining is that I collected the best 5 minute power number I've ever recorded...and that came at the end of the race.&nbsp; Looking forward to the Blue Hills Classic and another chance for success.&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
