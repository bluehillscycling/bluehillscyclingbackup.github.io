<div><span><b><i><span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Jonathan Doller--Cat 4&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><span><span lang="EN">I know everyone talks about the importance of &ldquo;recovery,&rdquo; but I never knew first-hand how important it really is until this week.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;After completing the B2B last Saturday and then riding 4 times during the week averaging 40-45 miles each, my legs were pretty spent going into the weekend.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;By Friday, I was regretting riding so much.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;My legs were heavy and the &ldquo;burn&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t going away as fast as usual.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;But, the White Mountain Cycling Classic is a really nice race (including a free T-shirt and free lunch after!) and I wasn&rsquo;t going to miss it.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;<span>
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-54"></a></p>
<div><span><span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;This race has a little bit of everything, which always makes for a challenging day in the saddle.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;It consists of 9-laps (which they shortened to 8 due to time, I believe) on a rolling circuit that has a couple of steep ramps, a couple of ripping descents, a few dicey corners and a long false-flat drag along the Kancamagus Highway.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;The constant accelerations and decelerations tend to make the peloton yo-yo quite a bit and, if you&rsquo;re caught out, it can take a really big effort just to latch back on. Add to that the fact that the Cat 4 boys seemed a little tentative on the descents into the corners.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;I felt like I had to brake a lot more than I wanted to and wasted a lot of speed and momentum.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Oh well, better to have a safe race than a fast one where guys end up on the tarmac.<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&nbsp;Luckily, having done this race last year, I sort of knew what to expect and managed to stay well-positioned throughout the race.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;The first lap, which is usually no more than a shake-down lap, was interesting, to say the least.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;We had something occur that I had never experienced.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;As we approached the start&#47;finish at the end of the lap, the officials stopped the entire peloton and pulled us off the course!&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Apparently, there were reports of guys violating the yellow line rule on the Kanc.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;It must have been behind me, because I didn&rsquo;t see anything from where I was.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;At any rate, the whole field basically got put in &ldquo;time out&rdquo; for a few minutes while the official gave us a scolding.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;We had to let the Cat 5 field (which started a few minutes after us) pass before we were released.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;So now, in addition to racing each other, we were also dodging the Cat 5 guys who had gotten dropped.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;The whole thing was a bit strange, to say the least.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Once we got back to racing, the laps started ticking by with a couple of small attacks on the hills and a couple of little digs on the Kanc.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Each time, however, the whole field was back together in a matter of minutes.<span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;It was definitely looking like a group sprint finish.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;The last time up the climbs, I slipped off the lead group a bit, but was able to catch back on by the time we took the right-hander onto the Kanc for the final time.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;However, right when I needed a little recovery from my effort just to catch back on, someone up front decided it was time to put the hammer down!&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;I struggled to hang on for a few minutes but finally got tailed off the back with about 4 other riders with about 2 miles to go.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;The lead group was tantalizingly close, maybe 200 meters up the road, but the group I was in didn&rsquo;t have the legs to catch back on before the final turn into the Loon Mountain parking lot.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;Knowing we weren&rsquo;t going to factor in the finish, I sat up a bit to ride to the finish.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;When the guys I was with started sprinting for the 16<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;place finish (where were those legs when we were chasing, boys?!), I was content to just spin across for a 20<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;<span>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;place finish at 28 seconds behind the winner.&nbsp;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;

<div><b><i>Bart Lipinski - Masters 35+&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>After somewhat of a peak two weeks ago at Killington, I was trying to ride it out as long as possible. Trying to rest as much as possible, but not too much as to fall off the edge I was trying to stay on. I was kind of looking forward to this race even though I wasn't sure what to expect. Last year I finished 29th and with guys like Mark McCormack in the field, left me a little further in doubt.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Still wasn't sure during the first lap. Legs were still feeling heavy. &lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-55"></a>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I few small breaks, but nothing seemed to last longer than a lap. I was almost sure nothing was going to stick so I buried myself in the group and tried to do as little as possible to save everything for the last climb and field sprint.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The masters 35+ race consists of 5 - 11 miles laps. Each with just over 800' of climbing per lap. The last 1K is almost exactly the same as the Blue Hills service road. 3 steps to the top with a 200M sprint to the finish.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>At the end of the 3rd lap two riders got off the front and opened up a sizeable gap. About half way through the 3rd lap two more took off. I'm sure everyone was thinking the same as myself. They aren't going to get caught. Just a little bit further up the (about<span>&nbsp; &lt;&#47;span&gt;3&#47;4's of the way through the 3rd lap), something told me to go. Luckily, no one followed. One and a quarter laps to go and I was trying to bridge a gap to two guys that were trying to do the same. &lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I did manage to catch the two ahead of me just as they were catching the two leaders. Unfortunately for me I caught them at the base of the big 1K climb (but was able to keep pace with the 4 others). We all worked pretty well together for the last lap. Just before the road started to tilt up for the last 3 or 4 miles, we heard one of the course marshals' yell out "one minute thirty seconds!" I was peaking back from time to time, but was relieved that we were that far ahead and we were not going to get caught.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>As we made the last right hander to head straight up, I knew two were going to go and it was going to come down to the a fight for 3rd. I managed to pick the right wheel and followed the 3rd place rider right up to the 50 meter line and flew around him not giving him a chance to get me back. I crossed the line 3rd. And very happy that this one was over. Because the second place rider was from out of state, that moved me to a silver in the state championship. Second to Mark McCormack in the State Championship!!! Thats when it sunk in. Second to an ex-pro and an ex-national champion. I'll take that any day. Well....maybe.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I didn't do much during the race until the last lap and a quarter. For the race I averaged only 221 watts (272 NP) for the 55 miles. &lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Had a nice big steak and a couple of Harpoons when I got home with the family.....and definitely looking forward to a couple of weeks of rest.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
</span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></span></div></i></b></div></p>

<div><span><b><i>Pete Werner &ndash; Solo Men&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>When I arrived at Pat&rsquo;s Peak for the 6 hour endurance race, the rain had just stopped. They received 3 inches of rain in the last 48 hours and the last remaining bit of snow on the mountain had finally melted. The ground was saturated from the snow that was blown all season so the course was going to be extremely muddy.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><br />&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The race started really fast. The course went up hill immediately. It was very muddy and pretty steep in spots. With all of the congestion, mud and steep turns there was a lot of running, walking and pushing.&nbsp; My heart rate was well into the 180&rsquo;s which is not where I want to be in the first 30 minutes of a 6 hour race.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-56"></a>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The latter half of the course was awesome. The course started to descend back to the base. There were lots of technical rocks and drops to negotiate all with really big puddles on the other side that hid any potential obstacles.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I made a wrong turn on Lap 1, 2 and 3 which cost me a bit of time. I was focusing so hard on staying up right that I just wasn&rsquo;t paying attention to the course. By Lap 4 I started to settle in. I started to really rock the course and get into the groove. Right about when I started getting comfortable, my small chain ring blew of the bike. I think all of the mud had finally caught up to my drive train. I really needed that chain ring, but now I had to rely on the middle ring. &nbsp;I am no stranger to standing up an grinding it out but with all of the mud, it was very difficult to get any traction in a 32 tooth chain ring so there was going to be a lot more walking and running next to my bike.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>By the end of Lap 4, my rear brake completely failed. This was very problematic and led to me crashing on&nbsp; a very steep, narrow muddy descent on the end of Lap 4, 5 and 6 (Lap 7 I finally was smart enough to walk it). I think I missed my brake more than the chain ring.&nbsp; I realized by lap 5 that I was starting to lap a number of riders in my field. This really kept me going and took my mind off of all of the mechanical mishaps that were bringing me down.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I finished with 7 laps which put me in 5<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;&nbsp;place. I was 6 minutes behind 4<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;&nbsp;place. Time to rebuild the bike for the next one. New chain rings, bottom bracket and pads are on order from Landry&rsquo;s.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
