<div><span><b><i>Bart Lipinski - Masters 40+&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Ok&hellip;.here it goes. A quick report on this past weekend&rsquo;s Killington Stage Race. In as few words as possible.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><b><i>Friday (day before stage 1)&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt; &ndash; Spent way too much time checking the hourly weather reports, but in a weird kind of way was excited about racing Stage 1 with weather in the low 40&rsquo;s, high winds and rain in the forecast. Not sure why&hellip;.but I was.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-57"></a>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Saturday, Stage 1 Circuit Race, 51 miles &ndash; 40+&rsquo;s were scheduled to start at 9:30, but had already changed my mind about racing in today&rsquo;s weather. Everyone was pretty much soaked as we rolled out to the neutral start. Right off the start, two guys went, but were eventually caught about 20 miles in. At that point I think it&rsquo;s pretty much safe to say that the entire field wanted this to be over. A safe and cautious ride to the finish.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Luckily for me, I had wrapped my cleats in plastic bags and tapped the hell out of them. Then put shoe covers on over them to hide them. They worked great for the first two laps. On the decent of the last lap, feet were wet and I got that &ldquo;death chill&rdquo; that you can&rsquo;t get rid of. By the end of the race, hands and fingers didn&rsquo;t work. Finished 17<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;, but had the same time as most of the favorites. Plenty of time to make it up in the next two days.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>It took about 15 minutes of sitting in the car with the heat on before I was able to unclick my helmet. Oh yea&hellip;..thanks to hypothermia, I could not stop my boy from shaking. Food, drinks and about a half hour helped fix that. Back to the condo to eat and recover.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><b><i>Sunday, Stage 2 Road Race, 62 miles&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt; &ndash; Since we could see the finish line from our window, today&rsquo;s warm-up was making the 1,500&rsquo; decent down East Mountain Road. The forecast for today was looking really good. No rain (haha), but very cold. Only in the upper 40&rsquo;s-low 50&rsquo;d for the day. Nothing like racing in the end of May in my winter clothes.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>As we rolled up to the start line&hellip;.rain&hellip;.again. Was nothing like Saturday, but WTF? We only were about 3 to 4 miles in when two went off the front (and not to be seen again). The race leader had guys trying to real them back in, so we just sat in and let them do all the work (although once again, I did way too much work&hellip;haha&hellip;surprise). There was a small break (2 guys) at about mile 40. That&rsquo;s the one I wish I acted on. These 2 finished 2<sup>nd&lt;&#47;sup&gt;and 3<sup>rd&lt;&#47;sup&gt; on the stage. But I was worried about having enough left in the tank to get back up the mountain.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>We got through the first 56 miles in just over two and a half hours. The last five were straight up. 1,500&rsquo; that would take almost 25 minutes to get to the top. Luckily I found my rhythm, and got to the top just about as fast as I was hoping to. Shaved over 3 minutes off my best time and crossed the line 11<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;, 2 minutes back from the guys I should have chased. But was very happy that I moved to 11<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;overall in the GC and that Stage 2 was in the books.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><b><i>Monday, Stage 3 Time Trial, 11 miles&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt; &ndash; Finally some sun and bright blue skies. Today&rsquo;s only issue was the wind. 15 mile an hour winds from the North West. Of course that was the direction we were heading. The finish line was also up about 500&rsquo; over the start line. So, a steady 11 mile TT climb, with a head wind. &lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Today&rsquo;s plan was simple enough&hellip;.Make the Podium. This was my chance to really move up in the GC. But right after I left the start, I realized the head wind was not just a head wind. In the valley (Rt. 4&#47;100) it was swirling. Sometimes from the front, or the right. But it would immediately switch to the left or maybe a quick push from behind. With a 80mm front wheel (only mistake I made today), I think I spent more energy trying to hold the bike straight and upright than what was going into the pedals.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The 11 miles went by quickly and before I knew it, I was sprinting with whatever I had left. I was done, it was over. And when the stage and overall GC results went up I could not believe my efforts took me to 2<sup>nd&lt;&#47;sup&gt; for the stage and moved me from 11<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;to 6<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt; overall in the GC.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>All in all, it was a great weekend to race. Ever with the shitty weather. It was great to stay with Ari for 4 days and to see and hang out with a few other friends&hellip;.off the bike for once. Next year I&rsquo;ll be on the final podium&hellip;.I promise.&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;

<div><span><b><i><span> &lt;&#47;span&gt;Bart Lipinski - Masters 35+&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<p>Ok, so first off, I think I paid way too much attention through out the week to the weather. Rain and thunderstorms were predicted for Saturday all week. I have only done this race once before as a Cat 5 and it was cold and the sky&rsquo;s opened up. Could not see a thing, so there was always a bad taste in my mouth about this one. Thankfully, the rain held off and there was not much more that a steady drizzle for the last 3 laps. The ground was wet, but at least you could see the road and the potholes. &lt;&#47;p&gt;<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-58"></a></p>
<p>Saturday morning was kind of a weird one. I almost didn&rsquo;t even want to ride my bike, let alone race. There was no doubt that I was racing, just one of those days I felt like doing nothing.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>The race, long neutral start to the course and was feeling ok. The first few laps a guy here or there would get out a 30 second lead or so, but this was a lazy group. No one wanted to work and when someone did get off the front, teammates would block (very narrow roads).&nbsp; Two others did get out for about two laps, but everyone was back together for the last lap.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>For most of the race I was focusing on my riding position and being where I though I should be. I almost didn&rsquo;t even care about the results. Killington is 2 weeks away, the road is slick, figured I&rsquo;d play it save today.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>But&hellip;.I was able to but myself in a pretty good position. The last &frac12; mile (about 140&rsquo; up) took you into the town square, where with about .1 miles to go, a sharp right and about an 8% sprint up to the finish line. A fast lead out by one team took the pack from a group of about 30 riders to a single file line (coming into the sharp right hander). I was about 9 or 10 wheels back, turned right and dumped what I had left. Picked up all by 3 guys to finish 4&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>
<p>There were a few times I tried to get in a break (didn&rsquo;t work) or bridge the gap, but other than that, really didn&rsquo;t do much. I think that I finally figured out how to ride smart, especially when you have no teammates. Well....maybe.&lt;&#47;p&gt;</p>

<div><span><b><i>Andy Rothstein &ndash; Cat 4&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />In preparing for and thinking about the Blue Hills Classic I felt that coming over the top of Unquity when everyone was gassed from coming up the hill would be a good time to attack.&nbsp; Apparently the eventual winner was thinking the same thing because I think that&rsquo;s where he attacked after the first time up the hill. &nbsp;When he was not too far in front I considered catching up to him.&nbsp; But, I did not take any initiative and figured that since he was alone the group would catch him. &nbsp;Others must have been thinking that too because no one went for him.&nbsp; He was soon was out of sight.&nbsp; And then out of mind.&nbsp; There was no organized pursuit and we were racing for second place.&nbsp; &nbsp;The second to last time up Unquity I began to think about positioning for the finish.&nbsp; I wanted to be in the front 1&#47;3 of the group so that I would not have to work too hard and when we went up Unquity again I would be positioned so as to not get caught behind struggling riders and so that my efforts would be expended at the front of the race and not trying to get to the front.&nbsp; That plan worked well and I finished 3<sup>rd&lt;&#47;sup&gt;&nbsp;in the group&hellip;4<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;&nbsp;in the race (remember, there was a lone breakaway).
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;

<div><span><b><i>Jonathan Doller &ndash; Cat 4&lt;&#47;i&gt;&lt;&#47;b&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>The race started out innocently enough, but that would soon change.&nbsp; I saw Andy Rothstein feign an early move to see who would respond, but no one did.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re going to ride 27 miles together and then settle this on the final climb,&rdquo; I thought.&nbsp; Boy, was I wrong!&nbsp; Passing the ski slope for the first time, I took the opportunity to get out front and open the throttle a bit and stretch the legs.&nbsp; On that fast section of the course, I knew I wasn&rsquo;t really going to do any damage, but it sure felt good to ride with clear roads in front of me!&nbsp; The first time up Unquity saw Sean Pantellere from STAMPEDE! attack over the top and would pretty much never be heard from again.&nbsp; He got such a gap so fast that I think most of the field (myself included) didn&rsquo;t even realize he was away (note to self: pay more attention).&nbsp; Needless to say, the KOM on lap two was a formality as Pantellere was so far off the front that he was out of sight&mdash;not easy to do on the BHC course.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m pretty sure part of the reason we were never able to organize a chase is that most of the field didn&rsquo;t realize that we were chasing!&nbsp; The peloton stayed together for the remaining three laps with the pace quickening gradually as we approached the deciding climb up Unquity.&nbsp; I was in good shape making the final right-hander and just tried to avoid riders slipping off the pace as both the speed and the incline increased.&nbsp; I managed to do just that and got across the line in 7th place from the pack and 8th overall behind Pantellere.&nbsp; With Rothstein grabbing a strong 4th, I&rsquo;d say it was a good day for BHCC in our home race.

&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>Chilly cloudy morning, but luckily the sun poked out just in time for the start of the M40+&rsquo;s.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>First lap a Wheelworks rider took off, but was reeled back in by the end of the first lap. On the 2<sup>nd&lt;&#47;sup&gt; lap, myself, a CCB rider and Expowheelman joined the Wheelworks rider and I was pretty sure we were going to get away. These were 3 strong riders and a good group to make something happen&hellip;&hellip;well for at least a &frac12; a lap or so. It seem like the only time throughout the race the group showed any concern.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>A few more guys would peel off the front for a bit and a CCB rider almost made it without getting caught but it was coming down to a field group sprint. Ari was a great help in giving me just enough of a rest to get ready for the last climb up Unquity.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I stayed about 10 wheels back and made sure to stay as far to the left as possible (as to not get boxed in). Just at the little flat before the last little climb to the finish I saw a rider out of the corner of my eye start to get out of the saddle&hellip;that was my queue to start my sprint.
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>I went as far as I can to the left on the sprint, but the guy that initiated it was fading and trying to get out of the way. Of course he would swerve to the left. It kind of pinched me off just a bit, but don&rsquo;t think it was enough to stop me from getting third. Was happy to take at least 6 spot on the sprint and not get passed. Definitely very pleased with taking 4<sup>th&lt;&#47;sup&gt;, but pissed I missed out on one of the sweet medals&hellip;..
<p>&lt;&#47;p&gt;&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;</p>
<div><span><br />&lt;&#47;span&gt;&lt;&#47;div&gt;
<div><span>A couple of more tune ups (Duxbury TT and Sterling) before Killington. Feeling pretty good right now.
